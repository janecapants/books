# Books Project
## This project shows the use of react components to show book information.

## Description
### This is a web page that shows book data. I changed some of the elements of Bootstrap that had already been implemented. There is a photo above each of the book entries. The color of the cards is green and the text is white. I centered the cards and the title on the top of the page. I also centered the material under 'H5'. I changed the body background color to black. I resized the card squares as well.

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up a terminal path and open the HTML file. 

## Furture Improvements
### Something I want to work on for most of the projects, is to get the text to be more animated and fun.
